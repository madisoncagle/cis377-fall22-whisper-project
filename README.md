# CIS377 Artificial Intelligence Whisper Project

## Using Whisper
To run the experiments in the Jupyter Notebooks, clone/fork this repo and run the cells in each notebook. Note: Transcribing files from the Speech Accent Archive dataset in `saa-test.ipynb` may take 15+ minutes to complete with a CPU.

To conduct your own experiments or use Whisper with individual files, follow the instructions in OpenAI's [official repo](https://github.com/openai/whisper#setup).

For troubleshooting, see [discussions](https://github.com/openai/whisper/discussions).
